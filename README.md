- 👋 Hola, I’m @brianbloom
- 👀 I’m a data geek and researcher. I am in a career switch from previously being an engineer and systems analyst to focusing on psychology and neuroscience. But I still code a bit for fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and R to add some more tools to my data analyst skillset.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything data science related, *especially* if it involves any of the following buzzwords: affective psychology, neuroscience, empirical studies, research methodologies, data wrangling, gender identity, APA Division 44, CNM, LGBTQIA*, AASECT
